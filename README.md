Movie Recommendation System
===========================

Project Overview:
-----------------
This project is a content-based movie recommendation engine built using Python and Streamlit. It recommends similar movies based on the title, genre, and description using natural language processing techniques.

Key Features:
-------------
• Uses CountVectorizer and Cosine Similarity for text analysis and similarity scoring  
• Content-based filtering – no need for user ratings  
• Streamlit web app with real-time movie recommendations  
 

Technologies Used:
------------------
• Python  
• Pandas  
• NumPy  
• Scikit-learn  
• Streamlit  
• Pickle (for model saving/loading)  

How It Works:
-------------
1. Cleaned movie metadata and extracted features like title, genre, and overview  
2. Converted text data into vectors using CountVectorizer  
3. Calculated similarity between movies using Cosine Similarity  
4. Displayed top 5 similar movies in a user-friendly Streamlit app
